[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source environment for statistical computing and visualization. It is based on the S language developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1980s. It is the product of an active movement among statisticians for a robust, programmable, portable, and open computing environment, applicable to the most complex and sophisticated problems,  without any restrictions on access or use. For over two decades, R has had an increasing number of contributed packages for handling and analyzing data for different domains. Although there are numerous books and online tutorials are available related to data processing analysis in R, I have to create this tutorial for the students of chemistry, environmental chemistry, soil chemistry, and environmental health.  Most of them have limited knowledge data processing and analysis in R.  This tutorial has organized with R-code and data that I have used in my several publications.  Most of the codes were written with the help of postings in several online blogs: such as  [R-sig-Geo](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-geo), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and [R bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/update-can-we-predict-flu-outcome-with-machine-learning-in-r/).
